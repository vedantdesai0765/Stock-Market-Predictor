# 📈 Stock Price Movement Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **stock price movement (Up/Down)** using Machine Learning by analyzing historical stock market data and technical indicators.  
The project follows a **two-phase approach**: exploratory analysis and experimentation using notebooks, followed by system implementation using modular Python scripts.

It is developed as a **B.Tech Final Year (Mega) Project** and demonstrates the application of **Machine Learning techniques in financial market analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and analyze historical stock market data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Clean and preprocess raw time-series data
- Apply feature engineering using technical indicators
- Build and evaluate Machine Learning models
- Predict next-day stock price movement (Up/Down)
- Prepare the system for deployment via an interactive dashboard

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Stock market prices are volatile and influenced by multiple factors, making prediction challenging.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a stock’s price will **increase or decrease on the next trading day** using historical price data and derived technical indicators.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Historical stock price data collected from **Yahoo Finance**
- Data stored in CSV format for reproducibility

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed using Jupyter notebooks
- Analysis includes:
  - Price trends
  - Volume behavior
  - Moving averages
  - Volatility patterns

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Implemented as a reusable pipeline in `src/data_preprocessing.py`
- Steps include:
  - Date parsing and chronological sorting
  - Handling missing values
  - Structuring time-series data
  - Saving cleaned output for downstream tasks

---

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Implemented and validated in notebooks
- Technical indicators used:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - MACD
- Feature-engineered data is used as input for ML models

---

### 5️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
- Implemented in `src/train_model.py`
- Key steps:
  - Creation of binary target variable (Up/Down movement)
  - Time-series–aware train-test split (no shuffling)
  - Training a baseline **Random Forest classifier**
  - Evaluation using accuracy metric
  - Saving trained model for reuse

---

### 6️⃣ Model Persistence
- Trained models are saved locally using `joblib`
- Generated artifacts are excluded from Git for clean version control
- Models can be regenerated by rerunning the training script

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization (EDA):** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Deep Learning (Planned):** TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)  
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance  
- **Dashboard (Planned):** Streamlit
